## Worksheet Objective

The objective of this worksheet is to familiarise you with key ROS (Robot
Operating System) concepts such as topics, publishers, and subscribers. These
elements are essential to understanding and effectively utilising ROS. While
this worksheet does not involve programming a robot, the concepts you learn
here will be instrumental for future activities where you will apply these
principles in actual robot programming.

## ROS2 Packages

As discussed in last week's lecture, a ROS2 package organises related code and
files within a named directory. This is a fundamental aspect of structuring and
managing projects in ROS2.

The lab worksheets that we will be releasing in the upcoming weeks, including
`lab1`, `lab2`, and others, are structured as directories located under
`~/ros2_ws/src`. Each of these directories is, in fact, a ROS2 package.

If you're interested, you have the option to create your own ROS2 packages. 
You can optionally learn more [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-Your-First-ROS2-Package.html).

## Talker (Publisher)

Let's begin by studying a basic publisher and subscriber, a concept we
explored in last week's lecture too. Our goal is to create simple ROS nodes that
exchange messages over the network.

In ROS, it's possible to use either Python or C++ for writing ROS nodes.
However, for this module, we'll concentrate on using Python. We need to
create two nodes: the publisher and the subscriber. These
nodes will exchange "Hello World" messages. You'll find
all the necessary files for this already included in your `lab2` package. Please
ensure that you have cloned this package as previously directed in the
info box provided at the top of this page.

Open the `talker.py` file under `~/ros2_ws/src/lab2/lab2/` and inspect its content.

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String


class Talker(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('talker')
        self.publisher = self.create_publisher(String, 'chatter', 10)

        timer_in_seconds = 0.5
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_in_seconds, self.talker_callback)
        self.counter = 0

    def talker_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        msg.data = f'Hello World, {self.counter}'
        self.publisher.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info(f'Publishing: {msg.data}')
        self.counter += 1


def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)

    talker = Talker()
    rclpy.spin(talker)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Here is an explanation of each line:

- Line 1 imports the necessary ROS library, `rclpy`. 
- Line 2 imports the `Node` class from `rclpy.node`. We will inherit from that
  class and implement new functionality. 
- Since our publisher will publish a String, we need to specify the type of the
  message. Hence, in Line 3 we import the ROS `String` type. 
- Between lines 6 and 20 we define our `Talker` class which inherits from
  `Node` class, making this class a ROS Node.
- Between lines 7 and 13 we implement the initialiser of the class.
    - In line 8 we call the superclass' initialiser passing in the name of the
      node.
    - In line 9 we create a ROS publisher. The first argument is the message
      type (a ROS `String`), the second (`'chatter'`) is a string with the name
      of the topic we want to publish to and the third argument is the outgoing
      message queue size.
    - In lines 11-12 we create a timer object. We pass first the frequency
    at which we want a method to be called (`timer_in_seconds`), followed by the
    method of the class we want to get called (`self.talker_callback`). This way,
    we create a way to keep running the `talker_callback` every 0.5 seconds.
- Between lines 15 and 20, we define the `talker_callback` method:
    - In line 16, we create a ROS String object (the message we will publish).
    - In line 17, we populate the message's `data` property with the f-string: 
    "Hello World, {self.counter}".
    - In line 18, we publish the message to the topic (i.e., `chatter`).
    - In line 19, we simply log a message (this is equivalent to printing a message 
    to the terminal, it's not actually publishing anything to the topic).
    - In line 20, we increment the counter by 1.
- In line 24, we initialise ROS communications.
- In line 26, we create an instance of our class.
- In line 27, we run the `spin` method, passing in our object, which keeps the
  Python script running until we kill it.


### Running the publisher node

We can use ROS commands to run our code. In a terminal window, run:

```
ros2 run lab2 talker
```

The `ros2 run` command is a ROS command that can run a code from a package.
We don't need to specify absolute path to file, instead we provide the package
and the name of the target. `ros2 run package_name executable_target`. ROS is able
to infer this from `lab2/setup.py` file.
You should notice the publisher logging its outputs in the terminal.

## Listener

Now that the publisher is "talking", we need to run the listener to listen to
the messages and print them out. Open and inspect the `listener.py` file.

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String


class Listener(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('listener')
        self.subscription = self.create_subscription(String, 'chatter', self.listener_callback, 10)
        self.subscription  # prevent unused variable warning

    def listener_callback(self, msg):
        self.get_logger().info(f'I heard: {msg.data!r}')


def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    listener = Listener()
    rclpy.spin(listener)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Explaining new commands (refer to the publisher section for the rest):

- In line 9, we create a subscriber to the `chatter` topic. We pass the
  following arguments: `String` which is the type of the messages we expect
  from that topic, `chatter` the name of the topic we want to subscribe to,
  `self.listener_callback` a method to process messages received from the
  topic, and `10` which is the queue size.
- In line 12, we define a callback for the listener, which defines a single
  parameter: `msg`, the message incoming from the topic.
- In line 13, we simply log the message received.

### Running the listener node

We simply need to run the listener node.
Open a new terminal window, make sure you are within a Singularity environment, and run:

```
ros2 run lab2 listener
```

Do you keep getting messages printed to the terminal? If so, well done!


## Using a ROS launch file

To set up this basic configuration, we had to utilise two separate terminal
windows: one to run the publisher node, and another for the subscriber
node. However, when operating a robot, which often requires running dozens or
even hundreds of nodes, manually opening and managing terminal
windows would be highly impractical and chaotic.

Fortunately, there's a more efficient solution available! This approach
simplifies the process of running multiple nodes, ensuring a more streamlined
and organised workflow.

Introducing ROS launch files ðŸª„.



ROS solves this problem with *launch files*. 
These files, which can be written in XML, Python, or YAML, serve as a
blueprint for running ROS applications. They consolidate the
instructions for launching various components of a ROS application into a
single, self-contained file. In this course, we'll specifically focus on
Python-based launch files, which offer a flexible and powerful way to
orchestrate the execution of multiple ROS nodes simultaneously.

We have an example under `~/ros2_ws/src/lab2/launch/chatter.py`. Open that 
file and inspect it:

```python
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node


def generate_launch_description():
    return LaunchDescription([
            Node(
                package='lab2',
                executable='talker',
                name='my_talker'
            ),
            Node(
                package='lab2',
                executable='listener',
                name='my_listener'
            ),
        ])
```

The file specifies two nodes that are going to be launched (lines 7 and 12). 
Note that we specify the package they live in, the `executable` is the file
name (i.e., `talker` for `talker.py`). The `name` simply gives a different name 
to the node when we run it. This can be useful if we need to spawn multiple 
such nodes.

Let's kill all previous nodes: in each of the terminal windows, use `CTRL-C` to
kill the nodes. Close all terminal windows. Now open a new terminal window and 
simply run:

```
ros2 launch lab2 chatter.py
```

Note that, to launch something, we need to specify the package (`lab2`) and the name
of the launch file (`chatter.py`). We can run this command from anywhere, we
don't have to be in the launch directory. However, you can even use `ros2 launch chatter.py` (without
specifying the package, `lab2`) if your current working directory is `~/ros2_ws/src/lab2/launch`.
Do you see the publishing/subscribing messages being printed? If so, well done!
That's more convenient, isn't it?


## Useful ROS commands

ROS provides many command line tools to inspect the state of the ROS
environment. For example, while your launch file is still running, in a new
terminal window run:

```
ros2 node list
```

This will list the names of all the nodes running currently in the ROS environment.

You can also get information about a specific node. For example, run:

```
ros2 node info /my_talker
```

Notice that, ROS gives you information about the type of this node, but also about 
the topics it is publishing to.
Try running `ros2 node info` for another running node and see what information you get.


Similar to `ros2 node`, there is also `ros2 topic` to get information about topics. Run:

```
ros2 topic list
```

This will list all the active topics in your ROS environment.

Again, you can get information about a specific topic. For example, run:

```
ros2 topic info /chatter
```

Notice that ROS gives you information about the type of the topic and the nodes
publishing to and listening to this topic. Try running `ros2 topic info` on other
topics you have seen in the `ros2 topic list` output.

Using `ros2 topic echo`, you can also listen to a particular topic. Execute:

```
ros2 topic echo /chatter
```

## Exercise: Writing a numeric talker and listener

Now that you better understand publishing/subscribing in ROS. It's your turn 
to write some code.

:::
#### Creating a numeric talker
:::

Create a copy of `talker.py` under `lab2/lab2` and save it as a new file
`numeric_talker.py`. 

Edit this file to include an additional publisher publishing
to a new `/numeric_chatter` topic with message type `Int8` (an 8-bit integer type).

Your talker should keep a counter starting from 0, increment it every time
(resetting back to zero at 127, which is the max value for a
signed 8-bit integer), and publish the value of the counter to the
`/numeric_chatter` topic. You will need to import the new message type to be able
to use it. Do not remove the String publisher to the `/chatter`
topic! A node can publish to multiple topics.

:::
#### Create a numeric listener
:::

Create a copy of `listener.py` under `lab2/lab2` and save it as
`numeric_listener.py`. 

Edit this file to include an additional subscriber to
the `/numeric_chatter` topic and print the received number in its callback
method. Do not remove the subscriber to the `/chatter` topic! A node can
listen to multiple topics.

:::
#### Create a new launch file
:::

Create a copy of the `chatter.py` file under `lab2/launch` and save it as
`numeric_chatter.py`. Edit this file to make the appropriate modifications to
only run the numeric version of the talker-listener nodes.

:::
#### Update `setup.py`
:::

Open `lab2/setup.py` file and locate the block of code
which reads:

```python
entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
        'talker = lab2.talker:main',
        'listener = lab2.listener:main',
    ],
},
```

This defines entry points for ROS. When we execute `ros2 run lab2 talker`,
ROS finds what to run from that block. `talker` is equal to the file
`talker.py` under `lab2` (`lab2.talker`) and we instruct to call the `main`
function of that script.

Now, you need to tell ROS about your new Python files. In the `lab2/setup.py`,
add two extra lines underneath the `listener = lab2.listener:main` for your two 
new Python files following the same idea but using `numeric_talker` and 
`numeric_listener` as target names.

:::
#### Build and test your code
:::

```{note}
Every time you make any modifications, even to existing Python files, you need
to run `colcon build` for the changes to be effective. There is a way to
symlink the files so you don't have to, but the default behaviour is not to
symlink.
```

In a terminal window go under `ros2_ws` and run `colcon build` to make the new
Python programs available to ROS. Test that your code works as expected by
running `ros2 launch lab2 numeric_chatter.py`.

:::
#### Saving your code on github
:::

When you think you have completed this worksheet, add, commit, and push your
new files (`numeric_talker.py`, `numeric_listener.py`, and any other related files
you might have created) and changes to the git repository with the correct git
message `Lab2 completed.`:

```
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/lab2
git add lab2/numeric_talker.py lab2/numeric_listener.py launch/numeric_chatter.py setup.py
git commit -m "Lab2 completed."
git push
```

You could also use `git add .` to add all files in the current directory.
If you visit GitHub and go to your `lab2` repository, you should see your 
new files there as well. Please double-check.

## Remarks and Checklist

This worksheet, while seemingly straightforward, lays the foundation for more
complex scenarios in robotics. Consider a scenario where the publisher
represents a robot and the subscriber is your computer. Instead of a simple
"Hello World" message, imagine the publisher is publishing an image captured
by the robot's camera sensor. The subscriber, rather than merely displaying the
message, could be a node that processes this image using Computer Vision
algorithms to make intelligent decisions. 

In such a context, the principles of ROS topics you've learned today become
critically important. The primary differences in more advanced scenarios will
be the type of message being published and the actions you perform with these
messages. We plan to explore such programs in upcoming worksheets,
applying the basic knowledge you're gaining now to more sophisticated
and realistic robot programming tasks.

Please check, by the end of this worksheet, that ...

- You understand what ROS topics are.
- You understand what ROS publishers and subscribers are.
- You completed successfully the exercises for a numeric talker and listener.
- You understand what ROS launch files are, and you know how to create one.
- You pushed your code to GitHub.

Assistants of the module for help during the lab hours, or contact me.
