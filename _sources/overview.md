# Overview

This webpage contains all the materials you would need for the lab sessions. You can 
think of it as a sequential tutorial to help you build practical skills of programming 
robotic systems. Please do follow these labs in the prescribed order. You will be using 
ROS2 (Robot Operating System), which is a software platform to host your robotic systems. 
A robot usually has many different components in hardware and software, which is an 
integration of sensors, acutators and algorithms. ROS2 allows you to integrate them 
all together seamlessly. It also provides a wealth of packages, such as SLAM, navigation, 
simulation, and controller etc. You will be learning the core concepts, and write your 
own codes to make packages. Then you will apply them to solve a navigation task that 
combines both motion planning and computer vision. There are corresponding excercises at 
the end of the each lab worksheet. Please do attepmt to tackle them as it help you to 
build up to solve the final task (in simulation only). The project task will be released 
in Week 6. This project is ***summative*** that accounts for $\boldsymbol{10\%}$ ***of your 
final grade***. We also provide real robots (turtlebot3 burger) for you to test your 
software after Week 6. The use of real robot is only formative. During the lab sessions,
we will be around to help you. Free feel to ask for help!
