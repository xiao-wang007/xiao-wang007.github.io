# Overview

This webpage contains all the materials you would need for the lab sessions. You can 
think of it as a sequential tutorial to help you build practical skills of programming 
robotic systems. Please do follow these labs in the prescribed order. You will be using 
ROS2 (Robot Operating System), which is a software platform to host your robotic systems. 
A robot usually has many different components in hardware and software, which is an 
integration of sensors, acutators and algorithms. ROS2 allows you to integrate them 
all together seamlessly. It also provides a wealth of packages, such as SLAM, navigation, 
simulation, and controller etc. You will be learning the core concepts, and write your 
own codes to make packages. Then you will apply them to solve a navigation task that 
combines both motion planning and computer vision. There are corresponding excercises at 
the end of the each lab worksheet. The solution to each lab exercise will be released end of 
the corresponding week. Please do attempt to tackle them as it is a progression 
for the final ROS2 project (in simulation only). The project task will be released 
in Week 6 with specifics about the task and how to submit. This project is ***summative*** 
that accounts for $\boldsymbol{10\%}$ ***of your final grade***. We also provide real 
robots (turtlebot3 burger) for you to test your software after Week 7. The use of real 
robot is only formative. From week 6 onward, the lab contents will be fully delivered. Then
you can spend the lab sessions working on the project. During the lab sessions, we will be 
around to help you. Free feel to ask for help!
