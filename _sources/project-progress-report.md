# Group Project: Progress Report (5%) Details

**Project Contacts:** Rafael Papallas (r.papallas@leeds.ac.uk), Andy Bulpitt
(a.j.bulpitt@leeds.ac.uk), Duygu Sarikaya (d.sarikaya@leeds.ac.uk)

```{note}
The deadline for the progress report is **22nd March 2024 5pm**.
Late submissions will be awarded 0% unless there are [mitigating 
circumstances](https://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/10111/assessment/860/mitigating_circumstances).
```

The progress report should be maximum of 1 page outlining the progress
of the group thus far, the plan and how tasks were allocated to group members and any issues
with group member contributions. **You should submit only one such report per group,
not one per member**. If you experience issues with contributions from
certain members, please raise them in this report now. We will attempt to help
by contacting them early on.

## Mark Scheme

This report should not be a complete description of the work, but a rough
estimate of what needs to be completed and who will complete each work.
Here is the mark scheme:

- Overview of the progress so far (1-2 paragraphs) [1 point].
- A list of work completed so far including who completed the work [1 point].
- A list of future work planned and who is to complete the work [1 point].
- A rough overview of the solution you are planning to implement (high-level description) [2 points].
- Any issues with the group members or a statement that everyone is contributing to the project.

Please note that we will read the report carefully and we will award full marks only
if the required effort is being put to the project planning and the report writing. 
Please, make sure that you think critically of the project's requirements and
propose a high-level solution that is sound.
